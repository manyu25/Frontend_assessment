To start the project use npm i and npm start command

**Tech Stacks Used:**
React.js: For building the dynamic and interactive user interface.
Tailwind CSS: For creating a responsive and modern design with utility-first CSS classes.
Node.js: Used in the backend for the server-side functionality (if required).
LocalStorage: For maintaining persistent data (like wishlist) even after page reloads.

**Key Features Implemented:**
Product Search and Filter: Allows users to search for products by name and filter them by category (like sarees, boys' wear, etc.).
Wishlist Functionality: Users can add products to their wishlist, which is saved locally using the browser's localStorage.

**Future Enhancements to Make the Project Stand Out:**
Advanced Product Filters: Implement multi-level filters for size, color, price range, etc., to enhance the shopping experience.

Implementation: This can be done by adding more filter options and updating the product list dynamically based on the selected filters.
Customer Reviews and Ratings: Users can leave reviews and rate products, helping others make informed decisions.

Implementation: A form to submit reviews, stored in the database, and displayed with the respective products.
Personalized Recommendations: Using AI/ML to recommend products based on user preferences or past purchases.

Implementation: This could be implemented with a recommendation system using simple algorithms or API integrations to suggest products.
User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and access personalized features like their wishlist, order history, etc.

Implementation: Use Firebase or JWT for secure user authentication and session management.
Real-time Stock Updates: Display real-time product stock status, ensuring users know if an item is in stock or out of stock.

Implementation: Integrate with the backend to show live product stock information.
Payment Gateway Integration: Add a payment system like Stripe or PayPal for users to securely complete their purchases.

Implementation: Use the respective APIs for integration with React and secure payment handling.
I have ensured that the website is responsive and works well across all devices. I believe with these additional features, the project could offer a much more interactive and personalized experience for the users.
